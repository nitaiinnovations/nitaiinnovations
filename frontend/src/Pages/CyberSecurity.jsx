              weaknesses that could be exploited by malicious hackers. This

          Penetration testing, often referred to as pen testing, is a proactive
          security assessment that simulates real-world cyberattacks to identify
          weaknesses in your systems, applications, and networks. By uncovering
          potential vulnerabilities before malicious actors do, penetration
          testing helps you strengthen your defenses and protect your sensitive
          data.

          In our experience, successful penetration tests rely heavily on manual
          testing. The skills and abilities brought to the table by an
          experienced penetration test team emulate those of the threat. While
          Automated Vulnerability Scanners and Exploitation Frameworks do have a
          place, they are severely limited by the signatures or modules
          contained in the tools.
