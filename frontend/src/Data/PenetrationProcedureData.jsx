      description: `In this phase, our security experts collect detailed information
      about the target network without performing any intrusive
      tests. They review network details, usage scenarios, and
      relevant documents. This helps them gather important data
      like domain names, server names, IP addresses, a network
      map, who owns the systems and services, and any limits on the
      tests they can conduct. This information will be crucial for the
      next steps.`,

      weaknesses and check if systems have the latest updates. The
      results include a list of vulnerabilities, details on which
      applications or services are affected, the current patch levels,
      and any potential denial of service risks. System security risks
      are assessed by comparing the collected information with
      public security databases and online sources related to the
      systems being tested.`,

      title: `Manual Penetration Testing`,
      description: `In this step, vulnerabilities identified earlier are manually
      validated. These verified vulnerabilities are then categorized as
      either harmless or harmful. Harmless vulnerabilities may be
      subjected to controlled exploitation to assess their impact,
      provided we obtain explicit customer consent. For harmful
      vulnerabilities, further exploitation is conducted only with the
      customerâ€™s approval. The outcomes of this phase include a
      detailed demonstration of how these vulnerabilities were
      exploited.`,

      title: `Report Generation`,
      description: `A comprehensive report is produced, outlining all identified
      vulnerabilities within the network and systems, accompanied
      by tailored recommendations for mitigating each identified
      risk. Based on the assessed risks within the IT infrastructure,
      we will propose strategic solutions and formulate an
      implementation plan to bolster security. This plan will
      encompass recommendations for applying patches, enhancing
      security practices and policies, and selecting appropriate
      security products to address the identified vulnerabilities
      effectively.`,
