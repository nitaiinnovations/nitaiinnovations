      and address security weaknesses in your network. It helps
      uncover vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers and

      system is fully protected. Security threats constantly evolve, and
      vulnerabilities can go unnoticed. Regular assessments, like
      penetration testing, can help confirm that your system is
      genuinely secure and up-to-date with current security practices.`,
