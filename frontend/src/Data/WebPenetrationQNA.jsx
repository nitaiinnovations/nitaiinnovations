      title: `What Is Web Application Penetration Testing?`,
      description: `Web application penetration testing is a comprehensive process
      and controlled security assessment that evaluates potential
      vulnerabilities and weaknesses hidden in a web application’s
      architecture, design, and configuration to detect cybersecurity
      risks. The primary goal of this testing process is to identify and
      mitigate security-related risks to improve and strengthen the
      
      overall security of your web application before they get identified
      and exploited by real-world cyber attackers.`,

      title: `Who carries out a web application penetration test?`,
      description: `Web application penetration tests are commonly assisted by
      experienced cybersecurity professionals known as penetration
      testers or ethical hackers. They have depth knowledge of web
      application security and utilize various latest tools, techniques,
      and methodologies to simulate real-world cyber attacks. Their
      goal is to identify vulnerabilities, assess security risks, and provide
      valuable insights to organizations. And enabling them to enhance
      the security posture of their web applications and protect against
      potential threats and data breaches.`,

      title: `What occurs after a web application penetration test?`,
      description: `Once the web application penetration test is conducted, the
      penetration testers or the ethical hackers involved in the process
      will create a customized written report for the client. This report
      will explain the identified vulnerabilities and the whole process,
      including locations where vulnerabilities were found, their
      associated risk levels, reference links, and videos. Moreover, a
      report of recommendations will also be provided for
      implementing appropriate remedial measures. This report will act
      as a manual for the web application technical team to understand
      and protect from future potential cyberattacks.`,

      title: `How penetration testing can secure a web application?`,
      description: `Web application penetration testing is conducted with the aim to
      secure a web application. We at Nitai Innovations follow a
      comprehensive approach to discover vulnerabilities and risks
      present in a web application. Our pen testers perform deep
      penetration testing by using a hybrid framework (automated, in-
      house tools, and manual testing) to identify every vulnerability.
      And upon completion of penetration testing, we build a detailed
      report explaining the scanning process, vulnerabilities identified,
      
      their locations, and tools used, with relevant screenshots, videos,
      and reference links. And towards the end of the web application
      penetration testing process.`,
